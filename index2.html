              Nigerian soups are the trademarks of the ethnic groups they
              originate from. Most Nigerians soups incorporate many vegetables
              and protein, and are usually finished off with palm oil or a
              stew/sauce. Today, Nigerians across communities enjoy all types of
              soups available. Here's a selection of six: Banga soup, Ofe
              Owerri, Efo riro, Okra soup, Ogbono soup and Edikainkong. Banga
              soup is made by extracting the juice from the seeds of raw palm
              kernel fruit. The seeds are cooked till they are tender and then
              pounded thoroughly until the juice is extracted and cooked. The
              Efik/Ibibios call it Abak Atama; the Yorubas call theirs Obe Eyin
              Ikpogiri.
